# Dictionary App

A dictionary app which displays phonetics, definitions, synonyms and pictures.

## About the project

I made this dictionary app to explore different APIs and use the data received from them to experiment with React's props system.

## Built with

- React
- NPM
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- css3

## Findings

As I was building the application I noticed how the props method of data passing became increasingly inefficient as components got more and more nested - requiring prop drilling. This would therefore lead to an increase in complexity in much larger projects; where context or Redux would likely be used in combination with props.
